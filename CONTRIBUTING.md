## Purpose of This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to provide solutions for Project Euler problems for educational purposes and personal growth. We aim to encourage algorithmic thinking, mathematical problem-solving, and the spirit of learning.

## Before You Begin

1. **Respect Project Euler's Ethos**: Project Euler discourages the public dissemination of solutions. Any contribution should be for educational purposes and should not diminish the challenge for others.
2. **Familiarize Yourself**: Ensure you understand the problem thoroughly and have tested your solution on the Project Euler platform before contributing.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
3. **Create a New Branch**: For every new contribution, create a separate branch.
4. **Commit Your Solution**: Add and commit your solution to the newly created branch.
5. **Push to GitHub**: Push your branch to your forked GitHub repository.
6. **Open a Pull Request**: Create a pull request from your forked repository to the original repository.

## Code Style and Standards

1. **Naming Conventions**: Ensure that file names clearly reflect the Project Euler problem number and title, e.g., `problem_001_sum_of_multiples.py`.
2. **Comments**: Comment your code where necessary, explaining your approach and any algorithms used.
3. **Optimization**: While not mandatory, optimized solutions are preferred. Ensure your solution can run within a reasonable timeframe.
4. **Test**: Before submitting, ensure your solution is correct by verifying it on the Project Euler platform.

## Pull Request Process

1. **Description**: Provide a concise description of the problem and your approach.
2. **Review**: Once submitted, your pull request will be reviewed. Feedback, if any, will be provided.
3. **Merging**: Upon approval, your solution will be merged into the main repository.

## Community Conduct

Please maintain respect and courtesy when interacting with other contributors. We adhere to a code of conduct, and any form of harassment, trolling, or negative behavior will not be tolerated.
